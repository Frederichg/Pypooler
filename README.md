The Pooler is a GUI (if possible with PyQT5) that allow the user to enter a SQL like request for the file he is interested about. One the files are selected they will sequentialy analysed by a function like the one we create for the Noémie 5CSRTT (see main.py). At the end an excel file will be create with all the results from each analysed files (work in parts).
