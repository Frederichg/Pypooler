Pypooler

The Pooler is using Index as a catalog of all the files in the Respository. There is a copy called Index3.xlsx (carefull the name of the 5 new files are not added yet to the index). 
Will need a GUI (if possible with PyQT5) that allow the user to enter a SQL like request for the file he is interested about. 
Once the files are selected they will sequentialy analysed by a function like the one we create for the No√©mie 5CSRTT (see main.py).
We have many different analysis and the proper analysis for a particular file is writen in the column 2
At the end an excel file will be create with all the results from each analysed files (work in parts).
